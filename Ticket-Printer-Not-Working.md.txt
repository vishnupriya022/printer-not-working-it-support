## Issue
User reported that the printer was not available. The printer did not appear in Windows settings and the system prompted to add a new device.

## Environment

- Device: Network Printer

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Opened Windows Settings → Printers & scanners.
2. Confirmed that no physical printer was detected.
3. Verified printer power and network connectivity.
4. Attempted to add printer using "Add device".
5. Restarted Print Spooler service.

## Root Cause
Printer connection was unavailable, so Windows could not detect the device.
